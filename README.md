# Chess-JS
Chessgame made in JavaScript/jQuery

My idea of this project is to build a multiplayer chess platform with the following features
- Full-functioning chess game
- User management (register/login)
- Database stored game saves (objects or strings)

# State of the project
Currently there is no version 1.0 as the game itself is not complete.
Missing gameplay features:
- Castling move
- Check/Checkmate
